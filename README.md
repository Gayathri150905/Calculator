# Calculator
A **calculator in Java** is a program that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Java logic and classes. It typically uses conditionals or switch statements to process user input and display results. It can be built as a console-based or GUI-based application using Swing or JavaFX.
